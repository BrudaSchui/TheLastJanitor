# TheLastJanitor

is a small game where you run around a school as the last janitor (because all of your janitor-colleagues are working from home) and you have to solve different tasks to collect points that count towards a high score. Helping you with solving the tasks quicker are so-called "Lewahittn", which can be bought at the "Strossa" and provide you with additional movement speed

## Map

The map is composed of various rooms, namely

-   Class rooms
-   Strossa (Lewahittn-Shop)
-   PC-Room
-   Hallway

## Tasks

There are a variety of tasks:

-   Repairing projectors (in the classrooms)
-   Breaking open lockers for student that lost their keys (hallway)
-   Plugging cables to PCs back in in the correct order (PC-Room)
-   Make sure that the students (NPCs wandering around) wear their slippers (hallway, PC-Room)
    -   There is no 100% guarantee that this task will exist in the final game, depending on whether I'll manage to create the logic for the NPCs

These tasks have a time limit within which they must be completed, otherwise it will be game over. You get rewarded points and a little bit of money upon completion of a task.

## Lewahittn

Lewahittn provide you with additional movement speed. The consumption of one of these power-ups fills a bar on your screen to tell you how long the boost will last, this duration increases over time. You can buy these nifty items at the Strossa for the small price of little money dollars.
